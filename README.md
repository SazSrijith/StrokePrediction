# StrokePrediction
In this stroke prediction analysis, by leveraging predictive modeling, the study aims to identify key risk factors and patterns that contribute to stroke occurrence. 
In this stroke prediction analysis, a comprehensive examination of diverse risk factors and predictive indicators is conducted to develop a robust model for forecasting the likelihood of stroke occurrence in individuals. The study incorporates a wide range of data sources, including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and genetic predispositions. Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze and identify patterns within this multifaceted dataset, enabling the creation of a predictive model that accurately assesses an individual's susceptibility to stroke. By leveraging this predictive analysis, healthcare professionals can proactively identify high-risk individuals, allowing for targeted interventions and personalized preventive measures to mitigate the incidence of strokes and improve overall public health outcomes.
